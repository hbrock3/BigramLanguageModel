    Program counts the frequency of co-occurences in the reuters dataset and
    transforms those counts to probabilites. It then asks for input and returns
    the input plus the next word.

    Even though it adds the next word and "completes" the sentence how the lab
    wants, these sentences don't always make sense and could still be considered
    unfinished.
